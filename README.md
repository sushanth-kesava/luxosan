**LuxoSan ‚Äì Hygiene Meets High Design**

In today‚Äôs world, hygiene isn't just about staying clean‚Äîit‚Äôs about feeling safe, cared for, and even a little indulged. That‚Äôs where LuxoSan comes in. Born from a vision to bring wellness, design, and sustainability together, LuxoSan is a mobile hygiene station crafted for the places we cherish most‚Äîluxury hotels, airport lounges, shopping malls‚Äîspaces where experience matters just as much as function.

At first glance, LuxoSan catches the eye with its sleek glass-metal body and calming ambient lighting. But its beauty goes beyond the surface. With a single wave of the hand, its smart IR tap delivers a precise sequence of soap and water‚Äîfully touchless, fully elegant. No buttons, no fuss‚Äîjust smooth, intuitive cleanliness.

But we didn‚Äôt stop at hands.

LuxoSan also recycles the very water you just used, sending it down to power a built-in underbody mop that sanitizes the floor as the station glides forward‚Äîquietly, efficiently, and sustainably. No buckets. No janitors. No wasted water. And when it‚Äôs done? It docks itself into a smart charging bay that tops up the battery, refills clean water, and disposes of waste‚Äîall on its own.

It‚Äôs not just smart. It‚Äôs self-aware.

And to make it truly welcoming for everyone, we added a vibrant OLED display for real-time updates and branding, multilingual voice prompts to guide users of all backgrounds, and even a built-in luxury scent diffuser‚Äîbecause hygiene should feel good, not just be good.

**Team:**

We are a team of three passionate innovators dedicated to developing sustainable and intelligent hygiene solutions for the modern world. Our combined expertise in embedded systems, hardware integration, and physical prototyping enabled us to build LuxoSan‚Ñ¢‚Äîan autonomous, touchless hygiene pod tailored for luxury spaces such as airports, hotels, and malls.

Kesava Sushanth ‚Äì Software & Logic Control Lead
            Developed the Arduino-based control system, managing sensor input, timed automation, and relay logic for fluid operations.
Vinjamuri Abhijna ‚Äì Design & Assembly Lead
            Led the physical structure and layout of the prototype, handling tank configuration, mop system placement, and overall build aesthetics.
Sharmila Priyadarshini ‚Äì Hardware & Integration Lead
            Responsible for circuit wiring, component integration, and power management to ensure smooth hardware functionality and system stability.
Together, we strive to create smart hygiene solutions that blend automation, design, and sustainability to meet the needs of future-ready public spaces.

**Key Features** 

LuxoSan combines sophisticated engineering with elegant design, offering a range of intelligent features that prioritize both hygiene and luxury. Each element is carefully crafted to deliver a premium user experience while ensuring optimal efficiency and minimal human intervention. 

Sleek Premium Finish:
          LuxoSan features a modern, glass-metal body crafted for visual appeal and durability. Its smooth contours and ambient LED lighting provide a futuristic aesthetic that blends seamlessly into upscale interiors, making it not just a utility but a design statement. 

Single Intelligent Tap:
          Equipped with an infrared (IR) sensor, the intelligent tap delivers a fully touchless handwashing sequence: dispensing soap for 2 seconds followed by a 30-second water rinse. This automated cycle ensures maximum hygiene while conserving resources and offering a consistent experience for every user. 

Greywater Reuse System:
          Innovatively sustainable, LuxoSan collects greywater from the handwashing process and redirects it to a built-in underbody mop. As the station moves, this mop cleans and sanitizes the floor‚Äîreducing water waste and maintaining a spotless environment without added manpower. 

Smart Docking Station:
          When not in use or in need of maintenance, LuxoSan autonomously returns to its smart docking station. This fully automated base handles wireless charging, fresh water refills, and waste drainage, all without manual input. Its magnetic auto-alignment and concealed fluid ports preserve the pod‚Äôs minimalist, touch-free design. 

OLED Display Interface:
          A vibrant, high-contrast OLED screen displays real-time system status, fluid levels, branding visuals, and custom messages. This ensures facility staff and users are always informed and engaged without interrupting the experience. 

Multilingual Voice Assistance:
          To make hygiene universally accessible, LuxoSan includes voice-guided prompts in multiple languages. From instructing users to extend their hands to sharing hygiene tips, this feature ensures inclusivity across diverse public settings. 

Luxury Scent Diffuser Module:
          Enhancing the sensory experience, an integrated aroma diffuser releases curated fragrances into the environment‚Äîevoking calmness, freshness, and sophistication. This subtle touch reinforces LuxoSan‚Äôs focus on user comfort and ambiance. 

Cloud-Based Dashboard:
          For operators and facility managers, LuxoSan offers a powerful cloud dashboard that remotely tracks pod usage, water levels, battery status, and maintenance needs. This smart backend allows for data-driven decisions, preventive servicing, and seamless scalability across multiple locations. 

**Technical Workflow **

At the core of LuxoSan is a carefully orchestrated automation cycle that ensures efficient hand hygiene and floor sanitation with minimal user interaction. The system executes the following operations in a seamless flow: 

Hand Detection via IR Sensor:
          As a user approaches, an infrared proximity sensor instantly detects the presence of hands, initiating the hygienic sequence‚Äîcompletely touch-free. 

Automatic Soap Dispensing:
          A precision peristaltic pump delivers a controlled amount of soap for 2 seconds, ensuring effective lathering without waste. 

Timed Fresh Water Dispensing 
          Immediately following, a solenoid valve activates to release a 30-second stream of clean water, enabling thorough rinsing while optimizing water use. 

Greywater Collection:
          The used water flows into a dedicated greywater tank, where it is safely stored and filtered for reuse in the floor cleaning process. 

Greywater Repurposing for Mopping:
          A submersible pump transfers the collected greywater to the underbody mop system. 

Automated Floor Cleaning While in Motion:
          As the pod navigates across the floor, the underbody mop deploys recycled water to clean and sanitize the area, reducing the need for additional manual labor or chemical cleaners. 

**Docking Station Highlights:**
            
            LuxoSan's smart docking station is a marvel of minimalist engineering, enabling fully autonomous operation without disrupting the aesthetic or spatial design of the venue: 

Flush-Mounted Design with Magnetic Auto-Alignment:
The pod effortlessly aligns with the dock using an internal magnetic guidance system, creating a seamless connection every time without the need for manual handling. 

Wireless Charging and Fluid Management:
The docking system supports wireless power transfer and features sealed, self-locking ports for fresh water intake and greywater disposal, maintaining hygiene and preventing spills. 

Completely Button-Free Operation:
True to its touchless philosophy, the docking station contains no visible buttons or switches. Every action‚Äîfrom charging to tank refill and waste drainage‚Äîis fully automated and monitored in real-time. 

**Environmental & Social Impact:**
LuxoSan is designed not just for convenience, but for meaningful contribution to sustainable development and public health goals. Its adoption brings several environmental and societal benefits: 

Significant Water Conservation:
By recycling greywater for floor cleaning, LuxoSan dramatically reduces water consumption, supporting green operations in urban facilities. 

Promotion of Public Health and Hygiene:
Through its touchless interface, multilingual guidance, and automated cleaning, it encourages hygienic behaviour and minimizes the spread of pathogens. 

Support for Smart Building Certifications: 
LuxoSan contributes to modern building standards like LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and GBCI (Green Building Certification Inc.), aligning with eco-conscious architectural practices.
